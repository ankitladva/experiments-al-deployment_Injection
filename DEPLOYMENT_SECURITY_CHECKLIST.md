# 🔐 Deployment Security Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your KYC backend is properly secured before going live.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Backend Security
- [ ] API key authentication implemented
- [ ] WebSocket connections require API key
- [ ] All endpoints (except `/health`) are protected
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS/WSS enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured

### Frontend Security
- [ ] API key configured in environment
- [ ] WebSocket connections include API key
- [ ] Environment variables not committed to git
- [ ] Production build configured

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Environment variables set in hosting platform
- [ ] API key is cryptographically secure
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Rate limiting considered (optional)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Generate Secure API Key
```bash
# Generate a secure 256-bit key
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 2. Backend Deployment (Render.com)
1. Go to your backend service dashboard
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Add: `API_KEY` = `your-generated-key`
4. Redeploy the service
5. Verify the service is running

### 3. Frontend Deployment (Render.com)
1. Go to your frontend service dashboard
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Add: `VITE_API_KEY` = `your-generated-key`
4. Redeploy the service
5. Verify the service is running

### 4. Test Security
```bash
# Run the security test script
python test-security.py

# Or test manually
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-key" https://kyc-backend-7f7c.onrender.com/api-key
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Security Tests
- [ ] Health endpoint accessible without API key
- [ ] Protected endpoints blocked without API key
- [ ] Protected endpoints accessible with valid API key
- [ ] WebSocket connections blocked without API key
- [ ] WebSocket connections work with valid API key
- [ ] Invalid API keys are rejected

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Frontend can connect to backend
- [ ] Video processing works correctly
- [ ] Color analysis functions properly
- [ ] S3 uploads work (if configured)
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

### Performance Tests
- [ ] API response times are acceptable
- [ ] WebSocket connections are stable
- [ ] No memory leaks during video processing
- [ ] Concurrent users handled properly

## 🚨 Security Monitoring

### Set Up Alerts For
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] High error rates
- [ ] Geographic anomalies
- [ ] Sudden traffic spikes

### Regular Security Reviews
- [ ] Monthly: Review access logs
- [ ] Quarterly: Rotate API keys
- [ ] Annually: Security audit
- [ ] As needed: Update dependencies

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend Won't Start
- [ ] Check environment variables
- [ ] Verify API key format
- [ ] Check port availability
- [ ] Review error logs

### Frontend Can't Connect
- [ ] Verify API key matches
- [ ] Check CORS configuration
- [ ] Verify backend URL
- [ ] Check browser console

### WebSocket Issues
- [ ] Ensure API key in URL
- [ ] Check WebSocket protocol (ws/wss)
- [ ] Verify backend WebSocket endpoint
- [ ] Check firewall settings

## 📋 Final Verification

Before going live, ensure:

1. **Security**: All endpoints properly protected
2. **Functionality**: Core features working correctly
3. **Performance**: Response times acceptable
4. **Monitoring**: Logging and alerts configured
5. **Documentation**: Team knows how to manage
6. **Backup**: Recovery procedures documented

## 🔄 Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily**: Monitor error logs
- **Weekly**: Review performance metrics
- **Monthly**: Security log review
- **Quarterly**: API key rotation
- **Annually**: Full security audit

---

**🎯 Goal**: A secure, functional, and maintainable KYC backend system.

**📞 Support**: If issues persist, check logs and run the security test script.
